                      How to Make a Pac-Man Board:

Part 1: Understanding the Different characters: 

- 'C' is Pac-Man's starting positions
- 'R','O','B','P' represent the ghosts of the colors Red, Orange, Pink, and 
  Blue respectively
- '*' are the energizers
- '#' is a wall
- 'X' is the ghost box
- '=' is the exit to the ghost box

Part 2: Requirments of a board csv file :

Each file must have 1 Pac-Man, 1 of each ghost, and at least 1 exit tile. 
The file must be a csv file.  Each row should have the same number of 
commas. You can leave blanks between commas, those will become the dots.
